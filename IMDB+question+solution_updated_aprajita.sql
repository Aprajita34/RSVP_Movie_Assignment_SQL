 To begin with, it is beneficial to know the shape of the tables and whether any column has null values.
 Further in this segment, you will take a look at 'movies' and 'genre' tables.*/



-- Segment 1:




-- Q1. Find the total number of rows in each table of the schema?
-- Type your code below:

-- 3867 number of rows

SELECT COUNT(*) AS ratings_table
FROM ratings;
-- 7997 number of rows

SELECT COUNT(*) AS genre_table

-- 15615 number of rows

SELECT COUNT(*) AS names_table
FROM names;
-- 25735 number of rows

SELECT COUNT(*) AS movie_table

-- 7997 number of rows

-- Q2. Which columns in the movie table have null values?
-- Type your code below:

-- Column names with at least one null value

SELECT 'id' AS Name_Of_Column, Count(*) AS Values_Null

-- country, worlwide_gross_income,languages and production_company have null values in movie table.



-- Now as you can see four columns of the movie table has null values. Let's look at the at the movies released each year.
